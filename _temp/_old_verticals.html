	<h3>Verticals</h3>
	
	<p>Even though the Latin alphabet is designed for horizontal writing, vertical signs are ubiquitous in the urban landscape. Bungee pays homage to these signs, particularly Art Deco marquees from the 1930s and 40s.</p>
	
	<p>Setting vertical text is tricky, and it is up to the designer to decide whether the visual punch of vertical text outweighs the readability issues that are certain to arise. Vertical text works best for large displays with short, familiar words. It is important that each word has well-defined left and right edges, as well as a strong center line. Special care must be given to letters that are unusually wide or narrow, such as I, L, M, and W.</p>

	<p>Bungee comes with a set of vertical caps designed especially for vertical use, and implements them with OpenType features that are usually used for vertical writing in East Asian scripts. Bungee’s straight-sided forms reinforce its left and right edges, and the letters I, L, M, and W take unconventional forms in order to flow better in vertical text. Bungee even has proportional vertical spacing, not to mention vertical kerning!</p>
	
	<p>Some design applications offer Vertical Type tools that can take advantage of Bungee’s vertical capabilities. For those that cannot, Bungee comes with a special Rotated version where each character is rotated 90° counter-clockwise. By setting this font in a text box that is rotated 90° in the other direction, you can simulate vertical text.
	
	On the web, you can set vertical text using CSS <code>writing-mode</code> and <code>text-orientation</code>, which are now becoming widely supported. <a href="https://github.com/djrrb/Bungee/blob/master/documentation/3-vertical-text.md">Learn more about how to use Bungee’s vertical forms »</a>
