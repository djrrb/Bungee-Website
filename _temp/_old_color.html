<p>Chromatic typefaces are nothing new: sets of wood type intended for overprinting were produced and marketed as early as 1841 and became a popular way for printers to add visual interest to their posters and broadsides. They became more and more elaborate as the nineteenth century progressed, but began to fall out of favor as typesetting became more mechanized in the twentieth century.</p>			<div class="figure_group">

			<p>Today we find ourselves in a renaissance of chromatic type. More and more digital fonts are following in the footsteps of their wooden forbears and are designed with layers for chromatic typesetting. Thanks in large part to the popularity of Emoji, color font formats are now in use, with Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe offering their own specifications. I am hopeful that Bungee can help users experiment with these formats, and am excited about all of the possibilities that chromatic fonts have to offer.</p>
